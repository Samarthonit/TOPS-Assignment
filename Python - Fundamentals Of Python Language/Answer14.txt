There are 2 Types of Indexes
Positive Indexes and Negative Indexes

So I Make a list of 1 to 5 Number
Number = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

if i want to see Number from Beginning in list so i will write 
Number[0] is 1
Number[1] is 2
Number[2] is 3
Number[3] is 4
Number[4] is 5
This is called Positive Indexes and Negative is Opposite of Positive Indexes
Means, if i want to see Number from Last in list i will write
Number[-1] is 5
Number[-2] is 4
Number[-3] is 3
Number[-4] is 2
Number[-5] is 1

Negative Indexes are useful when you want the last number from list without know the length of sequences.
